## Introduction
Most modern cities utilise public transport to ensure that its citizens may be able to commute within its borders. In Krakow the public transport system is governed by the ZTP (Public Transport Authority in Kraków). It was established to facilitate safe transport in Krakow and to manage the trasportation of Krakow's populus. This entity is responsible for the following:
>'Organising, supervising and conducting all matters related to public collective transport within the territory of the Municipality of Kraków and neighbouring municipalities in accordance with agreements concluded.'

Krakow's public transport is comprised of two main modes of transport, the first of which are trams.  
The trams in Krakow travel mainly throughout the road infrastructure within their own respective lanes. They utilize electrical cables overhead of the cabins, which provide electricity to, and power the vehicle.  
The trams are usually comprised of three-to-five segments, or cabins, connected by flexible 'accordion sections'. Most trams in Krakow have areas dedicated to wheelchairs and handicapped passengers.

Krakow's second most common mode of public transport in Krakow are the buses.  
The buses in krakow travel along the roads and are often electric, though there are older models which are hybrid or gas. They often contain at least one mobility seat or wheel-chair area. Some of the buses in krakow are made up of two segments, or cabins, connected by a center 'accordion section'.

For both modes of transport it is necessary to purchase tickets using ticket purchasing-machines, most busses and trams have at least one of these machines. These, or their online equivalents, must then be validated on the vehicle and the ride will be valid for the duration that the ticket lasts.
